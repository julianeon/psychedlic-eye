# About

I used a few components, and map, to fill the screen with eye emoji. I also used a button and a state variable to make it so you can increase or decrease the number of lines with eye emojis.

I used React and react-bootstrap's columns, iterating through them to make this little art piece. Try changing the values and see how it changes things.

This project was created with create react app.

## How to Run It

First, get the repo, by running the command git clone.

`git clone https://github.com/julianeon/psychedlic-eye.git`

Then, assuming you're already in your Downloads directory, cd into the app's directory:

`cd psychedlic-eye`

Run this command, to install all the ncessary dependencies:

`yarn install`

When that's done, run this command to actually run it:

`yarn start`

Most likely, it'll be at localhost:3000, so go to your browser address bar and type localhost:3000 to load it.

Then, to make changes and see their effects, cd into the src directory, open App.js, and edit away!
