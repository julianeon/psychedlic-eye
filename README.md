# About

This is a React tutorial featured also on the [Reactever](https://www.reactever.com) website.

Basically, I used a few components, and map, to fill the screen with eye emoji. I also used a button and a state variable to make it so you can increase or decrease the number of lines with eye emojis.

I used React and react-bootstrap's columns, iterating through them to make this little art piece. Try changing the values and see how it changes things.

This project was created with create react app.
